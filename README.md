# Goal_Tracker

This website is specifically designed for goal management, helping you stay organized and plan your daily tasks and life rhythm with ease.

You can freely add tags to each goal—such as "happy," "anxious," "important," or "urgent"—and categorize them in your own way to quickly identify the nature of each goal and improve your productivity.

The website also supports two types of goals: Scheduled Goals (with a specific completion time) and To-Do Goals (without a set time), offering flexibility to suit both structured and spontaneous planning styles.

In addition, the system automatically tracks the number of goals you complete on a daily, monthly, and yearly basis, helping you reflect on your progress and bring a stronger sense of direction to each day.

Currently, our core feature focuses on daily goals, but we will gradually introduce more advanced options, including yearly goals (e.g., what you want to accomplish in 2025), monthly plans (e.g., your key objectives for December), and weekly goals—empowering you to clearly navigate your journey, from short-term tasks to long-term ambitions!🌟

這是一個專為目標管理設計的網站，幫助您有條不紊地規劃每天的任務與生活節奏。
您可以自由替每個目標加上標籤，例如：「開心」、「焦慮」、「重要」或「緊急」等，依照自己的方式分類，讓您能快速辨識目標性質，提升管理效率。
此外網站支援兩種目標形式：時程表目標（可設定具體完成時間）與代辦目標（不設定時間的任務），滿足您在彈性與計畫性之間的不同需求。
系統也會自動統計每日、每月與每年完成的目標數量，幫助您回顧成就，讓每一天都更有方向感。

*目前我們以「每日目標」為核心功能，未來也將陸續推出更多進階選項，包括設定整年度目標（如 2025 年想完成的事）、每月計畫（例如 12 月的重點任務），以及每週目標，協助你從短期到長期，清晰掌握自己的節奏與方向！🌟*
